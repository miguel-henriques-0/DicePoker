    <string name="game_info">The game is played over N rounds, where N is an odd number chosen at the start.
        Each round consists of two turns, one per player. On their turn, players start by rolling all 5 dice and may,
        up to two times, hold any subset and re‑roll the remaining dice, for a maximum of three rolls per turn.
        At the end of the rolls, the player’s final dice combination is established (i.e., the player’s hand for the turn).
        Once both players have taken their turn in the round, their hands are compared and the higher-ranking hand wins the round.
        Then the next round begins, with the starting player alternating between rounds. After all N rounds are completed,
        the player who has won the most rounds is declared the victor.
        Dice combinations are ranked in descending order of strength as follows:
        Five of a Kind, Four of a Kind, Full House, Straight, Three of a Kind, Two Pair, One Pair,
        and finally Bust (no combination, hand strength determined by the highest die).
        These rankings adhere to the traditional poker-style hierarchy adapted for dice-based gameplay, with Five of a Kind placed above
        all other hands and excluding Flushes.
